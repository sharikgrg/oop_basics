### Definitions

#### class()
A class is an essential part of OOP:
Classes are the cookie cutters for objects/instances of a class
- a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object

###(self)
Self refers to the instance on which the method is being called

### instance of a class
It is a specific example of a class. It is not the class. It is unique but can be identical.

### Methods
are functions that can be used of/on a object of a specific class

### Abstraction
Is hiding complexity from the user and exposing useful/necessary parts to get something done.

An example would be turning on a microwave using the start button. We don't need to know about the particle vibrations and resonance - we just need to know our food will be warm

# Inheritance
The ability to inherit behaviour and characteristics from a parent class.
